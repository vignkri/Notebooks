    "- The fundamental property of gaussian is that multiplying two Gaussians result in another Gaussian\n",
    "- Central Limit Theorem states that if there are many measurements, the measurements will be normally distributed\n",
    "- Standard notation for a normal distribution for a random variable $X$ is $X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$\n",
    "    - This means that a value can be captured as a Gaussian by providing just two values that is the mean, and the variance. \n",
    "- Narrow Probability Density Distribution (PDD) points to higher sureness on the value\n",
    "- Wide PDDs indicate an uncertainty in the value\n",
    "- Standard deviations indicate how much of variation from the mean exists\n",
    "    - 68% of data falls within $1\\sigma$ deviation of the mean\n",
    "    - 95% of data falls wihtin $2\\sigma$ deviation of the mean\n",
    "    - If the average score is 85 with a standard deviation of 4.3, then 95% of students scored between 61 and 93.6.\n",
    "- The reciprocal of the variance $\\tau$ is the precision as variance is the precision of the data given a signal.\n",
    "     - small variance indicates higher precision\n",
    "- Precision of the measurement and the variance of measurement are different ways of stating the same fact"
