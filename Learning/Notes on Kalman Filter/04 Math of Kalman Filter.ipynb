    "Perfectly modeling a system is impossible except for the most trivial of problems. At any time $t$, we say that the true state is the predicted value from the model plus some process noise: $x(t) =  x_{pred}(t) + noise(t)$. After converting a higher order differential equations to a set of first-order differential equations, the system model without *noise* is: $\\dot{x} = Ax$ where $A$ is the systems dynamics matrix as it describes the dynamics of the system. We call the noise as $w$ and add it to the above equation. \n",
